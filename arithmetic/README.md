# Arithmetic Operations on Images

*1 Learn several arithmetic operations on images like addition, subtraction, bitwise operations etc.
*2 You will learn these functions: cv2.add(), cv2.addWeighted() etc.


Performance Measurement and Improvement Techniques 
=======================

In image processing, since you are dealing with large number of operations per second, it is
mandatory that your code is not only providing the correct solution, but also in the fastest
manner. So in this chapter, you will learn:

*1 To measure the performance of your code.
*2 Some tips to improve the performance of your code.
*3 You will see these functions: cv2.getTickCount, cv2.getTickFrequency etc.
